Objects & Their Internal Representation in JavaScript
Objects lie at the heart of JavaScript, wielding immense power in constructing dynamic applications. Internally, JavaScript engines employ efficient mechanisms to represent objects. Typically, objects are stored as dictionary-like structures, enabling flexible addition and removal of properties. 
JavaScript engines optimize object performance through techniques like inline caching and hidden classes, enhancing property access speed and memory usage. Objects can be created using constructor functions, object literals, or ES6 class syntax, each method influencing the internal representation. 
Mastery of object representation empowers developers to write efficient, scalable code, optimizing applications for speed and memory usage. In the dynamic world of JavaScript, understanding the internal workings of objects unlocks the potential for creating high-performance, innovative web experiences.
